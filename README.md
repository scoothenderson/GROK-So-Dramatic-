# GROK-So-Dramatic-
This is a personal project I am completing to build my skills towards NCEA level 2.
The concept of the code is simple:
This program needs to take in members and sort them into lists, organising them by their preferences. 
The program also needs to print these lists, displaying TOTAL MEMBERS, members who are HELPERS, and members who are ACTORS.
People can be in MULTIPLE lists
